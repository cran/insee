\details{
Query INSEE website to get series title from series key (idbank).
Any query to INSEE database can handle around 400 idbanks at maximum, if necessary the idbank list will then be splitted in several lists of 400 idbanks each.
Consequently, it is not advised to use it on the whole idbank dataset, the user should filter the idbank dataset first.
